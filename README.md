# Java script

JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.

The programs in this language are called scripts.
They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.

#### There are at least three great things about JavaScript:
- Full integration with HTML/CSS.
- Simple things are done simply.
- Support by all major browsers and enabled by default.
